# AutoIncrementor
A quick python script to increment/decrement text in a file with a keyboard press.

## What is this?
[A friend of mine](https://www.twitch.tv/thedugnutt) is using StreamLabs for Twitch streaming, and I noticed he had to save over a file in order to increment his death counter for his viewers. I wrote this in an afternoon to allow him to bind incrementing/decrementing to a keypress.
